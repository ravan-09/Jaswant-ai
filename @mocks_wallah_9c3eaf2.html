The loss of five lives during an air show at mid-day on Chennai‚Äôs Marina beach on October 6, organised by the Indian Air Force (IAF) as part of its 92nd anniversary, could have been avoided with better anticipation of the surge in spectators. The cause of death was attributed to heatstroke, though dehydration and suffocation may also have been factors. More than 200 people reportedly fainted. The IAF had issued advisories urging attendees to be well protected against the heat of around 34¬∞C to 35¬∞C. After the show, many complained of dizziness. Tamil Nadu Health Minister M. Subramanian said 102 individuals were sent to government hospitals nearby. In addition to the medical emergencies, chaos ensued on Chennai‚Äôs roads for hours. Metro Rail and Mass Rapid Transit System (MRTS) trains were overcrowded. Stations were extremely congested and services were insufficient. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin announced a solatium of ‚Çπ5 lakh each to the families of those dead. He attributed the traffic congestion to the ‚Äúoverwhelming response‚Äù, despite multiple departments coordinating preparations.</p> <p>This is not the first time that Chennai has hosted such an event. An IAF air show on September 6, 2003, drew an estimated 13 lakh people, just 2,00,000 less than this year. Notably, there were no heatstroke fatalities then, although two children went missing. Traffic management and train services were similarly chaotic. Clearly, lessons have not been learned. The blame should be shared not only by the State government, responsible for logistical support, but also by the railway administration for its inadequate response. Defence officials should have provided more critical inputs than they did, given their experience in conducting such shows nationwide. After the crash of a fighter jet at an air show in New Delhi on October 8, 1989, the IAF seemed to have addressed its weak points to ensure smooth events related to Air Force Day.
