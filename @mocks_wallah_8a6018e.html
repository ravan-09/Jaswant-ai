It would once have been considered unthinkable for permanent members of the UN Security Council to behave in this manner. His announcement was that in the event of a conventional attack on Russia by any country that is supported by a nuclear power, Russia would consider that a ‚Äújoint attack‚Äù and presumably, deal with the threat accordingly. He added that Russia could use nuclear weapons in response to a conventional attack posing a ‚Äúcritical threat to [its] sovereignty‚Äù, a threat that was repeated by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov at the UN General Assembly meet over the weekend, when he said the idea of defeating Russia on the battlefield is ‚Äúsenseless‚Äù and a ‚Äúsuicidal escapade‚Äù given that Moscow has nuclear weapons. Clearly, the context of Mr. Putin‚Äôs nuclear doctrine revision and the comments is Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy‚Äôs visit to the United States, where he attempted to present a new ‚Äúvictory plan‚Äù for Ukraine. Mr. Zelenskyy wants the permission of the U.S. and other western countries to use missiles and other heavy weaponry procured from them for attacks deep inside Russia.
