However, I was caught between the nervousness of having to set out alone or giving the occasion a pass.

The former meant giving up a glorious opportunity to meet a horde of extended family members.</p> <p>My dad came from a family of 13 siblings, most of whom have now moved on, leaving behind a sprawling clan of cousins who, over time, have built families of their own. Now with time, this family tree has grown phenomenally, with my cousins adding sons and daughters in-laws too. The invitation to the wedding meant having an enviable chance to meet many of them, and the list of people who had confirmed their attendance made me slaver. It was something I could not gloss over.</p> <p>Good health or not, this was an occasion I did not want to miss because in a world that is getting polarised faster than a sneeze, one thing we need to preserve is the ties that transcend differences — the bonds of family that remind us, no matter how far we have drifted, there are roots that still hold us together.</p> <p>The wedding promised to be more than just a celebration, it was a rare convergence of faces and stories I had not seen in years. A chance to relive old memories, forge new connections, and feel the warmth of belonging once again.</p> <p>In the days leading up to my journey, I found myself replaying fragments of childhood spent with these cousins — the carefree gatherings on family occasions, the teasing banter that stitched us together, and the quiet comfort of knowing we belonged to the same expansive family tree. Life had since scattered us across continents, and while social media kept us loosely tethered, it was not the same as being in each other’s presence — seeing familiar eyes light up, hearing voices unchanged by time, and embracing those whose touch still carried the warmth of home.</p> <p>I knew this gathering would be more than just a reunion, it would be a gentle reminder that no matter how far we wander, we remain connected by unseen threads woven from shared memories, loud laughter, and the silent understanding that we are part of something bigger than ourselves. And so, with a heart both anxious and eager, I packed my bags, not just for a wedding, but for a journey back to the roots that still held me fast.</p> <p>And boy, was I overwhelmed!

Each embrace seemed to unlock a memory. Conversations flowed like an unbroken river, as if it had never stopped, carrying with them the warmth of familiarity and the quiet reassurance that some connections never truly fade.</p> <p>In those two days, I found myself moving through a reel of faces and voices, yet each encounter felt personal and profound as if no time had lapsed at all. It was not just a family gathering, it was a homecoming for the heart, a reminder that love, in its purest form, doesn’t need constant tending to thrive.

The appropriate article 'A' should be used with the singular nouns 'day' and 'year,' as the context is general and not specific. Hence, the correct sentence is: 'A day is longer than a year on Venus.'"}, {"id": "141538", "question": "<strong>Select the option that expresses the following sentence in direct speech.</strong></p> <p>He told me that he would have finished the project by the following day", "options": ["<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"reload\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/reload.png\"/></p> I have finished the project by tomorrow,” he said to me.", "<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"check\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/check.png\"/></p> “I will have finished the project by tomorrow,” he said to me.", "<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"reload\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/reload.png\"/></p> “I will finish the project by the next day,” he said to me.", "<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"reload\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/reload.png\"/></p> “I would finish the project,” he said to me tomorrow"], "correct_answer": 1, "solution": "B) “<strong>I will have finished the project by tomorrow,” he said to me.</strong>\n\nDirect Speech में वाक्य को बदलते समय, Reported Speech का Original रूप बहाल किया जाता है। दिए गए वाक्य में, Indirect Speech में \"he told me that he would have finished the project by the following day\" दिया गया है। Reported Speech में 'he would have finished' Future Perfect Tense को Indirect में दर्शाता है। Future Perfect Tense को Direct Speech में बदलते समय, इसे \"will have finished\" में परिवर्तित किया जाता है। \"By the following day\" को Direct Speech में \"by tomorrow\" के रूप में लिखा जाता है। इसलिए, सही विकल्प होगा: \"I will have finished the project by tomorrow,\" he said to me.\n\nWhen converting a sentence from Indirect to Direct Speech, the original form of the Reported Speech is restored. In the given sentence, the Indirect Speech is \"he told me that he would have finished the project by the following day.\" In the Indirect Speech, \"he would have finished\" represents the Future Perfect Tense.
