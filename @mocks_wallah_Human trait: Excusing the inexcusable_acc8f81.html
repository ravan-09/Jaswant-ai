Man, who is considered rational, has been using his reasoning in a wrong and perverted way. He has either been rationally explaining the defects of his personality and flaws of his character as his sterling virtues, or he has been using reason wrongly to justify his uncivilised behaviour as necessary for the well-being of his community or the security of his country.</p> <p>He has been rationalising even his vulgar, barbarous, or animalistic behaviour as biologically ‘natural’, psychologically justified, and politically beneficial. Like, in the past, until recently, any woman who gave birth to many children was considered ‘very fertile’ and the father of those children was considered as ‘potent’, ‘manly’ or ‘masculine’ in character. In other words, people adored his libidinousness and her sexual vigour, rather than took notice of the lack of self-restraint or self-control on the part of the man and the woman.</p> <p>Likewise, one who could slaughter large numbers of people, even for a tyrant ruler or for an aggressive and ambitious nation, was considered a ‘brave warrior’, a ‘courageous soldier’ or a ‘national hero’. In other words, people praised the quality of one’s being a greater butcher, i.e. a killer, and less attention was paid to the quality of forgiveness or compassion.</p> <p>Moreover, they rationalised aggression as an ‘instinct’, as an in-built psychological response, or as genetically correct behaviour. It is this kind of rationalisation that has resulted in the present state of the world. Man’s faults of character have now acquired global dimensions and are now threatening the very existence of society. Yet his attempt to rationalise his irrational behaviour continues to be. Man’s arguments justifying his habits of smoking, drinking alcohol or taking a non-vegetarian diet also are due to his tendency to rationalise the irrational. A matter of more pity is that he does not recognise that he is arguing in favour of irrational and harmful behaviour.</p> <p>Unless he realises this wrong tendency, no global problem can be solved. As stated earlier, this tendency to rationalise the irrational has led to small and individual defects taking the form of global problems. For example, man’s libidinous tendencies, which were earlier justified on biological or psychological grounds, have now resulted in the grave danger caused by over-population, promiscuity, illegitimate children, rapes, abductions and the threat of the spread of AIDS.</p> <p>The threat caused by overpopulation is not less than the one caused by nuclear weapons. Yet man does not try to have self-restraint, self-control or continence. Instead, he tries to rationalise his irrational and errant behaviour since that suits his perverted instincts, and emotions, and gives him short-lived pleasure even though it is a great strain upon his stamina and moral health.</p> <p>The same can be said of his tendencies of aggression and greed. His justification of his self-interest and the wrong notion of security has led the world into the morass of grave economic imbalance and the race for war weapons. Hence there is an urgent need to put man’s rational faculty on the right track and, thereby, enable him to put an end to his irrational, irresponsible and injurious behaviour to save mankind from several global upheavals.</p> <p>There was a time when defects in man’s personality or faults in his character were considered as of individual concern. It was thought that society had no cause to bother about an individual’s habits, as it was believed that these can, at the most, be of concern to one’s family members or a few individuals who directly interact with that man. But now, with our better understanding, we know that defects in man’s personality are of concern not only to that individual but to the whole society as well because individual defects add up to global problems.

Leif Erikson is historically known as a Viking who explored new territories. <strong>Archaeologists'</strong> is the correct answer as they are professionals who study and uncover ancient artifacts, which aligns with the context of evidence being found at Vinland. <strong>'Settlement'</strong> fits because it refers to a place where people establish residence. The context discusses evidence related to Erikson's habitation in Vinland."}, {"id": "144903", "question": "<strong>Select the most appropriate form of comparative degree that can substitute the underlined segment in the given sentence.</strong></p> <p>Bilingual children are <ins><strong>so intelligent than</strong></ins> those who speak just one language", "options": ["<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"reload\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/reload.png\"/></p> so intelligent to", "<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"reload\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/reload.png\"/></p> better intelligent than", "<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"check\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/check.png\"/></p> more intelligent than", "<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"reload\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/reload.png\"/></p> the most intelligent to"], "correct_answer": 2, "solution": "C) 'so intelligent than' के बदले <strong>'more intelligent than'</strong> का use होगा क्योंकि Comparative Degree में 'more' का उपयोग किया जाता है जब adjective के साथ '-er' suffix नहीं लगाया जा सकता। 'Intelligent' एक multi-syllable adjective है, इसलिए 'more' का प्रयोग सही है। जैसे— She is more intelligent than her classmates.\n\n'more intelligent than' will be used instead of 'so intelligent than' because in the Comparative Degree, 'more' is used with adjectives that do not take the '-er' suffix.
