Thus, the Red Achcha Hai campaign. Started with a new vigour first in rural areas of Gujarat, and Rajasthan and later in Madhya Pradesh, the eye-catching Red Achcha Hai campaign tapped the power of drama and visual communication with the CHETNA team dressed in red explaining the menstrual process, the need for menstrual hygiene and breaking myths and taboos around menstruation.</p> <p>The positive impact of this awareness programme and distribution of 2199 menstrual hygiene management (MHM) kits containing three information booklets, a clothes brush, a nail cutter and a rope to dry the washed cloth, led to its continuation in 47 schools of Sansad block of Ahmedabad since February 2024.

However, after some discussions on the myths surrounding menstruation, the CHETNA team motivated her to come to the function.

It’s bad enough that India cannot be sure of which team it will be dealing with even a few months from now; what’s worse is that the UK government does not appear consistent about anything. After the Conservatives displayed some sense of purpose under Johnson in the trade talks, they seem to have backtracked. The present Home Secretary Suella Braverman recently made _____12______ remarks about Indians overstaying their work permits, hitting at India’s demand for easy immigration for professionals. The UK is clearly in no mood to reduce its trade barriers, with its current account deficit for 2022 expected to cross 7 per cent of GDP (according to OECD). In the context of India, it cannot risk further widening an £8 billion deficit in goods and services trade, in total bilateral trade of £25.7 billion in 2021-22. Its protectionist intent is borne _____13______ by the extension of safeguard duty and quotas on Indian steel. This has impacted exports of over two lakh tonnes, for which India has requested compensation. Meanwhile, in ______14______ India has imposed additional duty of 15 per cent on 22 import items from the UK, including cheese, Scotch, cosmetics, petroleum products and machinery items. Bilateral trade talks are obviously not a priority in this backdrop.But an FTA with UK can and should be taken up at the right time.
