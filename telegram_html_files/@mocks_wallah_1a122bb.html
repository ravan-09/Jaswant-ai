Almost everyone in their compartment was drinking tea too. ‚ÄúDo you know that over eighty crore cups of tea are drunk every day throughout the world?‚Äù Rajvir said. ‚ÄúWhew!‚Äù exclaimed Pranjol. ‚ÄúTea really is very popular.‚Äù The train pulled out of the station. Pranjol buried his nose in his detective book again. Rajvir too was an ardent fan of detective stories, but at the moment he was keener on looking at the beautiful scenery. It was green, green everywhere. Rajvir had never seen so much greenery before. Then the soft green paddy fields gave way to tea bushes. It was a magnificent view. Against the backdrop of densely wooded hills a sea of tea bushes stretched as far as the eye could see. Dwarfing the tiny tea plants were tall sturdy shade-trees and amidst the orderly rows of bushes busily moved doll-like figures. In the distance was an ugly building with smoke billowing out of tall chimneys. ‚ÄúHey, a tea garden!‚Äù Rajvir cried excitedly. Pranjol, who had been born and brought up on a plantation, didn‚Äôt share Rajvir‚Äôs excitement. ‚ÄúOh, this is tea country now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAssam has the largest concentration of plantations in the world. You will see enough gardens to last you a lifetime!‚Äù ‚ÄúI have been reading as much as I could about tea,‚Äù Rajvir said. ‚ÄúNo one really knows who discovered tea but there are many legends.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat legends?‚Äù ‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs the one about the Chinese emperor who always boiled water before drinking it. One day a few leaves of the twigs burning under the pot fell into the water giving it a delicious flavour. It is said they were tea leaves.‚Äù ‚ÄúTell me another!‚Äù scoffed Pranjol. ‚ÄúWe have an Indian legend too. Bodhidharma, an ancient Buddhist ascetic, cut off his eyelids because he felt sleepy during meditations. Ten tea plants grew out of the eyelids.
