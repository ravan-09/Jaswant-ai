With countless social media networks, endless group chats, and online ‚Äúfriends,‚Äù you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd feel fulfilled. But under the endless likes, comments, and selfies, there‚Äôs a haunting emptiness.<br> I often meet young people who, despite their vast online networks, feel utterly isolated. They are connected to everyone, yet truly close to no one. Take Rhea, a 22-year-old with a picture-perfect online life. Her feed is filled with smiling photos, exotic vacations, and witty captions. But behind this flawless facade lies a young woman scarred by painful experiences. She lost her father at five, faced years of abuse, and carries a deep, invisible wound. Rhea carefully hides this pain, crafting an online persona that feels safe and acceptable. ‚ÄúI keep thinking if I post the right picture, maybe I‚Äôll finally feel like I belong,‚Äù she admitted once, her voice breaking.<br> Yet the emptiness doesn‚Äôt fade. Her online ‚Äúfriends‚Äù see the bright exterior, but none see the broken girl within. Another story is of Arjun, a young man shaped by a chaotic home and constant content bombardment. Now 20, he spends hours scrolling through his feed, comparing himself to others who appear effortlessly perfect. ‚ÄúEveryone seems so complete,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut I feel like I‚Äôm failing.‚Äù<br> In a crisis, Arjun realises he has no one to truly rely on. His friendships, based on memes and brief exchanges, feel hollow when life gets tough. The endless scrolling only deepens his loneliness, as he sees everyone‚Äôs best moments while silently suffering through his worst. Rhea and Arjun‚Äôs stories echo a painful truth for many in Gen Z. Friendships today are often shallow, based on convenience rather than commitment.<br> They form and dissolve easily, leaving young people adrift in a sea of acquaintances who vanish when things get real. This generation‚Äôs friendships are filtered through screens, built on quick likes and superficial messages. The traditional bonds of trust and time are slipping away, leaving behind connections that feel fleeting and, ultimately, empty. What‚Äôs missing here is depth ‚Äî the kind of friendship that stands the test of hardship, that offers warmth and understanding beyond a screen.<br> For Rhea, there‚Äôs a wounded inner child who craves a friend who will listen and care beyond the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù image she shows online. For Arjun, there‚Äôs a desperate need to find a friend who sees his struggles, not just his shared posts. As a society, we need to understand that true friendship isn‚Äôt about quick exchanges or temporary validation.<br> It‚Äôs about sharing real moments, both joyful and painful. It‚Äôs about listening, being there, and caring without conditions. Perhaps, as Felice Buscaglia once said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not enough to have lived.‚Äù True living means creating joy, sharing love, and holding each other through life‚Äôs storms.
