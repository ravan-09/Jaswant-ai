The king mandated that day was to be treated as night and vice versa. Everyone complied out of fear of execution. In this topsy-turvy kingdom, everything, regardless of its value, was priced at a single duddu.</p> <p>A guru and his disciple entered this city and were perplexed by its practices. While the guru quickly discerned that they were in a kingdom of fools and advised his disciple to leave, the disciple chose to stay, lured by the cheap prices of goods. He feasted on the inexpensive food and grew considerably large and stout.</p> <p>One day, a thief died when a wall, weakened by age, fell on him during a burglary attempt. His brother sought justice, blaming the owner of the house, who in turn blamed the bricklayer that constructed the weak wall. This led to a comical blame game involving a dancing girl and a goldsmith, with the fault eventually coming full circle back to the original homeowner. The king, in his foolishness, decided to execute someone for the death of the thief. But the rich merchant, deemed the prime culprit, was too thin for the stake they had prepared for the execution. The fattened disciple, now plump and sizable, was deemed a perfect fit.</p> <p>As the disciple awaited his unfair fate, he prayed to his guru who, having mystical powers, arrived in time. The guru cunningly convinced the king that the first person to be executed on the stake would be reincarnated as the next king. Both the guru and disciple feigned a desire to be executed first. Believing them, the king and his minister, hoping to be reborn into their current positions, secretly went to the execution ground and met their demise.</p> <p>The next day, when their bodies were discovered, the city was in turmoil. The guru and disciple, on the verge of leaving the chaotic city, were begged by the people to become their new rulers. They agreed, but only if they could change the nonsensical laws. The kingdom returned to normalcy under their wise leadership, with the day and night resuming their usual roles and sensible economic practices reestablished.</p> <p><strong>Q45.
