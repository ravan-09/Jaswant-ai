The fourth report in the series was released on Tuesday. A synthesis of the earlier studies, it gives the world a chance to stem the crisis. The pace of increase in GHG emissions has come down in the past five years, the panel comprising some of the world‚Äôs top climate scientists points out. However, the world is perilously close to exhausting its carbon budget. ‚ÄúThe threshold beyond which the climate crisis becomes irreversible‚Äù could be breached by the first half of the 2030s, IPCC‚Äôs modeling shows.</p> <p>The Paris Climate Pact had agreed to check global temperature rise to 2¬∞C above pre-industrial limits and ‚Äúpursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels‚Äù. IPCC‚Äôs studies have consistently borne out the salience of the pact‚Äôs ‚Äúmore desirable target‚Äù and most countries today are on the same page about the 1.5¬∞C limit. To limit temperature increase below the breakdown level, temperatures must peak by 2025 and decline by 43 per cent in the next five years, scientists on the panel have underlined. In a business-as-usual scenario, temperatures could rise to well above 2¬∞C by the end of this century. Mitigation efforts currently underway need fast tracking to avert cataclysmic climate outcomes. The good news is that the world has the toolkit for the purpose. There is also near consensus on the links between the recent extreme weather events ‚Äî Pakistan floods, Hurricane Ian in the US, heatwaves and wildfires in North America, Australia and parts of Europe, the unpredictability of the monsoon in India, challenges faced by small island nations. But almost always, the concord seems to come apart on the question of shouldering responsibility. The reported disagreement on the fine print on fossil fuels in the earlier drafts of the IPCC‚Äôs latest report shows why ‚Äúcollective action‚Äù remains a fraught concept in climate negotiations.</p> <p>In about eight months from now, climate delegates will gather in Dubai for the UNFCCC‚Äôs 28th Conference of Parties (CoP). The summit is slated to evaluate progress towards attaining the Paris Pact‚Äôs targets. The latest IPCC report demands more initiative from them, especially on matters related to funds and technology transfer to the Global South.</p> <p><strong>Q41.
