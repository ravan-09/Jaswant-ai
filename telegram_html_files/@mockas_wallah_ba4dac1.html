As of today, the only GM seed permissible in India is cotton. The gain in cotton yield had prompted agricultural institutions, private and public, to develop GM seeds in food crops such as rice, wheat, tomato, brinjal and mustard though none has been released. These issues underpin the story of DMH-11, or Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11, that was developed under a publicly funded project at the Delhi University‚Äôs biotechnology department.

For crops to be approved under India‚Äôs agricultural system, they must be sown over three seasons in different agro-climatic zones and prove themselves to be consistently better than their existing comparators. Trials conducted over three years by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research suggest that DMH-11 passed these metrics.

Nagarathna and Sanjay Karol of the Supreme Court of India, delivering a split verdict on the question of allowing genetically modified (GM) mustard in farmer fields. As of today, the only GM seed permissible in India is cotton. The gain in cotton yield had prompted agricultural institutions, private and public, to develop GM seeds in food crops such as rice, wheat, tomato, brinjal and mustard though none has been released. These issues underpin the story of DMH-11, or Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11, that was developed under a publicly funded project at the Delhi University‚Äôs biotechnology department. The genes used in the plant make the crop suitable and lucrative to private seed companies for making newer hybrid varieties. For crops to be approved under India‚Äôs agricultural system, they must be sown over three seasons in different agro-climatic zones and prove themselves to be consistently better than their existing comparators.
