occur when financial systems experience severe disruptions, leading to a decline in asset values, business failures, and economic recessions. These crises can arise due to various reasons, such as excessive borrowing, poor risk management, or sudden external shocks. One of the most significant financial crises in history was the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008, triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market and the risky lending practices of banks.</span><span style=\"font-family:Hind\">  </span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;line-height:normal;font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Hind\">During the GFC, major banks faced insolvency, and global stock markets plunged. To prevent a complete economic collapse, governments and central banks introduced measures such as injecting liquidity into the banking system, reducing interest rates, and implementing stimulus packages. Despite these efforts, the crisis led to job losses, a slowdown in economic growth, and long-term financial instability in various countries.</span><span style=\"font-family:Hind\">  </span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;line-height:normal;font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Hind\">Financial crises do not only impact banks but also affect businesses and individuals. When financial institutions struggle, they reduce lending, making it harder for businesses to expand and consumers to access credit. This reduces economic activity, leading to rising unemployment and increased poverty. To mitigate future crises, governments have enforced stricter financial regulations, improved risk assessment measures, and promoted financial transparency.</span><span style=\"font-family:Hind\">  </span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;line-height:normal;font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Hind\">However, financial crises remain a recurring challenge.
