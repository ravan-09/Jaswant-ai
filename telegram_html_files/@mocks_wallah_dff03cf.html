The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his eldest son to watch; but about twelve o‚Äôclock he fell asleep, and in the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener‚Äôs son jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm; only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away. The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the council was called together.

Then the fox said, ‚ÄòDo not shoot me, for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you to be very poor and mean.‚Äô But the son thought to himself, ‚ÄòWhat can such a beast as this know about the matter?‚Äô So he shot his arrow at the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty, and poor. ‚ÄòI should be very silly,‚Äô said he, ‚Äòif I went to that shabby house, and left this charming place‚Äô; so he went into the smart house, and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.</p> <p>Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened to him.

Snowfall is not uncommon in the higher reaches of the Himalayas during this time of the year. What has come as a surprise is how frequently it has snowed in towns located at lower altitudes in Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. That‚Äôs a rare occurrence. Average temperatures have touched record lows. The northern plains have been spared the scorching heat associated with May so far. It‚Äôs a welcome relief, but the trend does raise concerns, especially as the climate crisis is predicted to lead to more such weather fluctuations. The impact on the onset of monsoon is being closely watched.</p> <p>Experts fear that intense heatwaves and extreme weather events are likely to become more frequent as the planet warms. An extreme heatwave was witnessed in parts of India and Pakistan last year. Between 2031 and 2060, there is a likelihood of mega heatwaves; the intensity could double between 2071 and 2100. Studies show that India recorded a 55 per cent rise in deaths due to extreme heat between 2000-2004 and 2017-2021. The warming of the Arabian Sea is expected to result in intense heat episodes in northwest and central India.</p> <p>Considering the widespread public safety concerns, a comprehensive heat action plan is now an unavoidable necessity. Cities have to be prepared to minimise damage as entirely new conditions are emerging. The vulnerable population has to be identified, infrastructure readied for emergency situations and awareness campaigns launched to highlight health risks associated with heat exposure. Corporates and voluntary organisations must be encouraged to install potable water dispensers across towns and cities.
