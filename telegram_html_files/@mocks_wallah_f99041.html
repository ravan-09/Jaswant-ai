In the past 10 years, the IMD‚Äôs ability to make long-range predictions over broad regions has improved appreciably. Yet, there are several days when predictions go wrong, especially during the southwest and northeast monsoons. The challenge today is not to predict average rainfall or temperature over the season, month or week. Extreme weather events that usually occurred once in a few decades now threaten people‚Äôs lives and livelihoods throughout the year. Weather forecasters need to find ways to alert farmers, municipal authorities, and office and schoolgoers about copious rainfall at hyper-local levels. Climate-induced vagaries have triggered disasters like the recent landslides in Wayanad and lake bursts in Sikkim and Uttarakhand last year. Administrators have often been caught off guard by the fury of the elements. Last year, when Kalyanapattinum in Tamil Nadu‚Äôs Thoothukudi district experienced an entire season‚Äôs rainfall in a day, Chief Minister M K Stalin blamed the IMD for not issuing advance alerts. The problem is that predicting such intense rainfall is virtually impossible today. States such as Kerala, Odisha and Maharashtra have sought the help of private agencies to augment IMD‚Äôs information. However, the fact remains that large gaps in knowledge will have to be plugged to make the country climate-resilient.</p> <p>While the previous improvements in IMD focused primarily on augmenting infrastructure, the latest endeavour will be directed at developing computer simulated models tailored to local specifics. This would require data collectors to narrow their focus to district, block, panchayat, village or even ward and street-levels. The scientists will also need to be equipped with a denser network of measuring instruments. Recent research has shown that AI can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts. The IMD has reportedly digitised the country‚Äôs weather records going back to more than a century. AI could be used to sift through this corpus to generate knowledge and help forecasters issue timely alerts. The met department would also do well to tap into research conducted in universities and institutions. Scientists at IIT Bombay, for example, used cutting-edge computing technologies this year to predict rainfall in the city with greater accuracy than the IMD. Another ongoing project at IIT Mandi hones into soil characteristics to predict landslides.</p> <p>Mainstreaming information on erratic weather would also require communicators conversant with local economic and cultural idiosyncrasies. The information will need to be disseminated to the most vulnerable.

One day, while walking through the local market, she stumbled upon a vibrant, multicolored umbrella hanging in a shop. Its beautiful colors sparkled under the sunlight, and Maya instantly fell in love with it. She used all her savings to buy it.</p> <p>Every day, Maya would walk around the village with her umbrella, even when there was no rain. The villagers admired the umbrella, but some, like the old shopkeeper <em>Hari</em>, grew jealous of it. Hari wanted the umbrella for himself. He thought it would attract more customers to his small, struggling shop.</p> <p>One afternoon, as Maya rested under a tree, Hari approached her, trying to strike a deal. \"I'll give you sweets for a year if you give me your umbrella,\" he said. Maya smiled and politely declined. The umbrella was special to her, not because it was beautiful, but because it symbolized the joy it brought to her and others.</p> <p>Days passed, and Hari's jealousy grew. One evening, he sent his young helper, <em>Raju</em>, to steal the umbrella. Raju, although hesitant, took it while Maya was distracted.</p> <p>When Maya realized her umbrella was gone, she was heartbroken. The village felt the change in her mood, and people began talking.
