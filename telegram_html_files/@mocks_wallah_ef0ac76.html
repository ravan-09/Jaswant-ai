Everyday in the morning he used to go to the forest to cut wood. In the evening he would sell the wood in the city. One day he went deep into the forest. It was a very cold winter. His fingers were becoming numb. Every now and then, the woodcutter would put down his axe and bring his hands close to his mouth. Then he would blow hard on them to warm them. While he was cutting wood Mian Balishtiye was watching him from a corner. Mian Balishtiye saw that the woodcutter kept blowing on his hands. He began to wonder what all that was about! But he could not understand it. He got up thinking that he would go and ask the woodcutter. After walking a little, he came back thinking that the woodcutter may not like being asked. Finally, Mian Balishtiye could not help himself. He went hopping to the woodcutter and said, ‚ÄúHello brother, if you don‚Äôt mind can I ask you something? Seeing this tiny person the woodcutter was amazed and amused. But, he hid his smile and said, ‚ÄúOf course, of course, ask what you want to.‚Äù ‚ÄúAll I want to ask is why do you blow from your mouth on to your hands?‚Äù said Mian Balishtiye. The woodcutter replied, ‚ÄúIt is too cold. My hands are frozen, so I blow on them to warm them up a little. Then, when they get cold again I warm them again by blowing.‚Äù Mian Balishtiye nodded, ‚ÄúOh, ho, so that‚Äôs it!‚Äù And with that he moved off. But he stayed nearby and kept a close watch on him. Soon it was afternoon. The woodcutter began to think of lunch. He picked up two stones and made a chulha. He lit a fire and put a small handi (pot) filled with potatoes to boil. The wood was damp, so the woodcutter bent down and blew on the fire to help it burn. Balishtiye was watching him from a distance. ‚ÄúArre‚Äù, he said to himself, ‚ÄúThere he goes again ‚Äì blowing from his mouth! Does fire come out of his mouth?‚Äù The woodcutter was feeling very hungry. He took out a potato from the handi. He tried to eat it but the potato was too hot. He again began to blow on it ‚Äì ‚Äòfoo, foo‚Äô. ‚ÄúArre,‚Äù said Balishtiye to himself, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs blowing again! Now what?
