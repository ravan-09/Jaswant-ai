Under this project, DRDO‚Äôs Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) will collaborate with various private and public sector agencies to develop the stealth jet and associated technology.

Firstly, it boasts stealth capabilities, rendering it nearly invisible to enemy radars due to its minimized radar cross-section. Secondly, it can achieve ‚ÄòSupercruise‚Äô, enabling it to fly faster than the speed of sound without relying on fuel-intensive afterburners. Thirdly, it is equipped with advanced avionics, sensors, and network-centric operations. Increasingly, artificial intelligence is being integrated to enhance the pilot-aircraft interface, allowing a single pilot to manage both flight and combat operations. Lastly, it has the ability to outperform adversaries by detecting and engaging targets from considerable distances, facilitated by active electronically scanned array (AESA) radars. Achieving stealth involves meticulously shaping the aircraft to scatter radar waves rather than reflecting them, in addition to employing specialized materials and paints known as ‚ÄòRadar Absorbing Structures‚Äô to further minimize radar reflectivity. In stealth mode, these fighters conceal their weapons within internal bays, relying solely on internally-carried fuel to avoid radar detection, as external weapons or fuel tanks compromise stealth by reflecting radar waves.</p> <p>The AMCA is slated for development in two phases.
