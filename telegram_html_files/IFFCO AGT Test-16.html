Despite its significance, the sector faces multiple challenges, including erratic monsoons, declining soil fertility, and inadequate storage facilities. To address these concerns, the government has launched several initiatives, such as the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) to provide crop insurance and the Soil Health Card Scheme to improve soil quality.</span><span style=\"font-family:Hind\">  </span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;line-height:normal;font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Hind\"> </span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;line-height:normal;font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Hind\">Furthermore, advancements in agricultural technology, such as precision farming and genetically modified crops, have improved productivity. However, the adoption of these innovations remains slow due to lack of awareness and high implementation costs. Cooperatives like IFFCO play a crucial role in bridging this gap by providing farmers with better fertilizers, technical assistance, and credit facilities.</span><span style=\"font-family:Hind\">  </span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;line-height:normal;font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Hind\"> </span></p><p style=\"margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;line-height:normal;font-size:12pt\"><span style=\"font-family:Hind\">A shift toward sustainable farming practices, including organic farming and water conservation techniques, is also gaining momentum.
