Crisp and importantly clean mountain air, long walks along jungle trails, beautiful sunrises and sunsets and views of snow-capped peaks in the distance, were only a few of the bonuses that the place offered.</p> <p>It was during this trip that three different people, in their way, tried to put us at ease, by referring to the facilities that they offered for the comfort of senior citizens. I would have bristled indignantly at a reference to my advancing age until only a couple of years back. Now I was not offended.</p> <p>I remember an incident about 25 years back. One evening, a younger engineer, recruited through campus placement and working with me, remarked, ‚ÄúSir, I am amazed by your energy. You work so hard and such long hours even at this age.‚Äù</p> <p>At 40, I could not take the Statement as a compliment that he had intended it to be and quipped rather caustically, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by this age? I am still young.‚Äù I would love to see his face today if someone were to remark to him about his age.</p> <p>I completed 60 five years back. That was the time I realised the benefits that I was entitled to as I booked my air or train ticket at a discount. I could conveniently travel in the metro trains sitting comfortably on the seats meant for seniors, till someone older than me, or at least someone who looked older than me, came and stood near me. Old habits die hard. I would offer my seat to the more needy or gallantly offer the seat to a much younger woman since that is what I was taught.</p> <p>But chivalry still had limits. I was not prepared to be called an old man or even an uncle by the younger people. Till we faced the onslaught of something terrible four years back - covid. It invaded our lives like nothing we had witnessed in our lifetime.</p> <p>I too had my share of the dread that many might have undergone during their last living moments. We understood the fragility of life. Many, much younger, did not make it through the nights. I did and realised the privilege of being called old.
