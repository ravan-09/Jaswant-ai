Simply put, their grievance is two-fold. One, they assert that Rs 11,400 for a month‚Äôs work (that‚Äôs Rs 380 per day) where a regular day involves handling at least 600 emergency calls (ranging from road accidents to crimes against women to harassment) is not adequate remuneration. What makes it worse is the fact that their salary hasn‚Äôt increased while the world around them has gone through upheavals, including a global pandemic and historic inflation. The second complaint of the communication workers is about the lack of job security since they are employed by a private firm, and not by the government. On the face of it, this is just one local protest. However, seen in the broader context of India‚Äôs employment data, this protest underlines a sobering reality, especially for women in India‚Äôs labour force.<br> When the official employment data for India was released last month, there were four key takeaways. One, that most of the headline indices continued to improve. These included improving the labour force participation rate (implying more people were demanding jobs), falling unemployment rate (implying the ratio of those who looked for a job and failed to get one is falling) and rising workforce-population ratio (implying that overall the ratio of employed people and the total population was rising). Two, that most of these positive changes were happening due to women entering the workforce. Three, that most of the new jobs were of very poor quality ‚Äî self-employment ‚Äî where monthly incomes are much lower than regular wages. Four, all types of incomes ‚Äî be it for regular wages, casual labour or self-employment ‚Äî had remained largely stagnant over the past six years. Simply put, women were entering the job market driven by economic woes.<br> The distress call from the women workers in Lucknow provides a real-life example of the macro data.
