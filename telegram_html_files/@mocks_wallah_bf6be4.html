The error lies in the preposition \"through\". Prepositions are words that express location or direction, time, or to introduce an object.

This followed from the Trumpist world view that the U.S. was being shortchanged by major polluters such as China and India. In the case of WHO, the case was over its ‚Äòinadequate‚Äô response time to the gravity of the pandemic originating in China. Following political change, President Joseph Biden has now brought the U.S. back into the fold of funding WHO as well as rejoining the climate treaty.</p> <p>Unlike the ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô policies that propelled the Trump administration‚Äôs exits, the U.S.‚Äôs UNESCO re-entry has little to do with why it exited it in the first place, which was, as it was believed, ‚Äúan anti-Israel bias‚Äù. The U.S., then and now, remains Israel‚Äôs staunchest ally and does not recognise Palestine. It is not unreasonable to infer that the re-entry is a sign of America‚Äôs growing paranoia about China. It is also appropriate to recall that the Reagan administration withdrew from UNESCO in 1984 for, among other things, ‚Äúadvancing Soviet interests‚Äù. Developments in AI are slightly different from historical technological developments. Here, product patents and their enforcement have helped countries such as the U.S. maintain their edge, but with AI, China, along with a rising repertoire of patents and research publications, has the advantages of a much larger population and a more powerful surveillance state. This feeds into a cycle of generating greater troves of data that in turn feed and improve machine learning systems that make its AI far more formidable. Unlike other technologies, no country can have a sustained, natural edge in AI indefinitely. America might bring in atleast $600 million in outstanding dues to the UNESCO but it is high time ‚Äî and countries such as India would do well to point this out ‚Äî that the organisation gets stricter on countries exiting and entering on frivolous grounds, alongside framing policies and research that accommodate the tussles of a hyper-connected world.<br> <strong>Q37.
