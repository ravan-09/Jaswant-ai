During a wrestling match, I met Anil, a man in his mid-20s who radiated kindness and simplicity. Trying to gain his trust, I flattered him, but he playfully responded. We spoke, and I managed to convince him to employ me, even if he couldn't pay. I lied about my culinary skills, but Anil soon realized my cooking was atrocious. However, he found humor in the situation and instead decided to teach me.</p> <p>Anil also introduced me to the world of letters, teaching me to write my own name, and promised to expand my knowledge to sentences and arithmetic. I was intrigued. I understood that literacy was a key to unlimited opportunities.</p> <p>Working for Anil was an interesting experience. I was responsible for buying daily supplies, often managing to pocket some change. Although Anil's income was unpredictable, it didn't bother him. He earned by writing for magazines, an occupation I found odd. One evening, Anil brought home a sum of money from selling a book. That night, I noticed him hide the notes beneath his mattress.</p> <p>Despite Anil‚Äôs trust, which he manifested by giving me a key to our shared room, the temptation was hard to resist. I pondered over the thought of robbing him. To my reasoning, Anil would waste the money anyway, and he never really paid me. One night, with the moonlight as my witness, I took the money and ran towards the station. With 600 rupees, the world was mine. But a hesitation at the station, a missed train, and a moment of introspection made me question my choices.</p> <p>The reality of my theft began to weigh on me. I imagined Anil's face, not angry or scared, but simply sad at the betrayal. On a rainy night, as the wet notes clung to me, I thought of the lessons and the promises of a brighter future. Maybe stealing was easy, but to be respected was a greater ambition.</p> <p>With a heavy heart, I decided to return the money. Sneaking back into the room, I placed the notes back under the mattress, hoping Anil wouldn't notice. The following morning, Anil casually handed me a wet 50-rupee note, stating it was my pay. His actions, though silent, spoke volumes. He was aware of my midnight escapade but chose understanding over anger.</p> <p>Anil's subtle gesture wasn't just a monetary transaction but a reaffirmation of trust. As he spoke of our writing lessons for the day, my gratitude and hope grew. I smiled genuinely, knowing that life had much more to offer than the contents of a stolen wallet.</p> <p><strong>Q45.
