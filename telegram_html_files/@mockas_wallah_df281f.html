Last week, controversy over the claims over the prowess of eye drops prescribed for presbyopia (progressive loss of the near focusing ability of the eye due to ageing), led to the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) suspending a pharma company‚Äôs permission to manufacture and market the product.
