It not only enabled the Centre to double the quota of free/near-free grain supplied to public distribution system (PDS) beneficiaries, the country also shipped out record quantities of the two cereals. Further, the FCI, from 2020-21, began selling surplus rice to distilleries for production of ethanol used for blending with petrol. But since January, the Narendra Modi government has restored the PDS quota to the original 5 kg/person/month.</p> <p>Between May 2022 and this month, it has banned exports of wheat and all non-parboiled non-basmati rice. And now, the FCI has halted rice sales to distilleries as well. This, more than a month after the Centre discontinued the supply of FCI grain to states under the open market sale scheme (OMSS).</p> <p>These actions convey a worry over grain availability in general and stocks in public warehouses. While current stocks are more than adequate and the monsoon too has been good so far, the uncertainty pertains to El Ni√±o‚Äôs impact down the line on both the 2023-24 rice and wheat crops. The Modi government obviously does not want to take chances ahead of national elections in 2024.</p> <p>Poor and vulnerable families have been largely insulated from retail cereal inflation thanks to the PDS. Ensuring enough stocks to keep that grain flowing would, then, receive topmost priority. Congress-ruled Karnataka may see politics in being denied 2.28 lakh tonnes (lt) of rice to provide poor households in the state an additional 5 kg/person/month ‚Äî and for which it was willing to pay FCI Rs 34/kg under the OMSS. But what if other states, including those under BJP, were to also make similar demands for additional grain? Nor is the 24.22 lt of rice supplied to ethanol distilleries since 2020-21 particularly huge. However, they all add up.</p> <p>Clearly, the Centre is not in a position to supply grain over and above the requirements of the PDS, which it is obliged to under the National Food Security Act. This wasn‚Äôt the case until quite recently.

On seeing Tricki on the street with his owner, he is taken aback by the dog's obesity. His condition reflects a life of overindulgence. Mrs. Pumphrey, a doting owner, admits to pampering Tricki with extra treats like cream cakes and chocolates out of concern for his listlessness. She believes that Tricki might be malnourished, so she supplements his diet with malt, cod-liver oil, and Horlicks. Moreover, the dog's exercise has been minimal since the gardener, responsible for Tricki's play sessions, has been ill.Herriot sternly advises Mrs. Pumphrey to reduce Tricki's food intake and increase his exercise, warning that the dog‚Äôs health is in genuine peril. Despite her initial determination, it's not long before Mrs. Pumphrey calls Herriot, distressed. Tricki is now refusing all food, vomiting, and lying around panting.Having anticipated this, Herriot recommends that Tricki be hospitalized for observation. Mrs. Pumphrey is initially resistant, fearing that Tricki would be distressed away from her. Nevertheless, she acquiesces, and Tricki is taken to the surgery, accompanied by a surplus of his belongings, including beds, toys, and coats, most of which are unnecessary.At the surgery, Tricki is initially indifferent to the other dogs. He is placed in a warm box and, for the first couple of days, is given only water. By the third day, Tricki starts showing interest in the other dogs.
