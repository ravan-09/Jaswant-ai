Medium term forecasts, such as those by the IMF, expect the momentum to continue over the coming years. However, concern over the lack of quality jobs continues to persist. The recently released periodic labour force survey provides granular information on the state of the labour market in India. Several trends warrant closer examination.</p> <p>First, at the aggregate level, the labour force participation rate (15 years and above) has risen from 49.8 per cent in 2017-18 to 60.1 per cent in 2023-24. However, much of this is due to the sharp rise in female participation, especially in rural areas, where it has risen from 24.6 per cent to 47.6 per cent over this period. While a rise in female participation should ideally be welcome, some have argued that it may be a sign of distress ‚Äî women stepping out of the house to augment their household income. As per the survey, the share of women engaged in salaried employment has fallen. More are now engaged in self-employment ‚Äî across the country, the share of women who are self-employed has risen from 51.9 per cent in 2017-18 to 67.4 per cent in 2023-24 ‚Äî either as unpaid helpers in household enterprises or as own-account workers. This indicates the absence of alternatives. Second, a large section of the labour force continues to be employed in informal firms. The percentage of workers engaged in informal enterprises (proprietary and partnerships) stood at 73.2 per cent in 2023-24. While it has fallen marginally from 74.3 per cent in 2022-23, it remains higher than the estimate of 68.2 per cent in 2017-18. Third, the share of the labour force engaged in agriculture continues to edge upwards, while that engaged in manufacturing remains almost stagnant. In 2017-18, 44.1 per cent of workers were employed in the farm sector.
