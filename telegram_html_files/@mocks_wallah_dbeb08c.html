King Vikram ruled his kingdom with a kind heart and an iron fist, ensuring that his people were happy and prosperous.One day, a sage named Dhanush visited King Vikram's court. The sage informed the king about an enchanted forest where a powerful spirit named Betal resided, causing trouble to the villagers. The spirit had possessed a banyan tree and would only be set free if someone managed to bring Betal back to the sage. Intrigued by the challenge, King Vikram decided to undertake this quest to rid his people of the troubles caused by Betal.As the sun dipped below the horizon, King Vikram ventured into the enchanted forest, guided by the sage's advice. The forest was filled with eerie sounds and shadows that seemed to come alive. Undeterred, Vikram made his way to the banyan tree where Betal was said to reside.

The World Bank has pared its real GDP growth forecast for the country to 6.3% from 6.6% it had estimated a few months earlier, and 7% projected in October 2022. The key domestic factors it flagged for the downgrade are: rising borrowing costs would hurt otherwise resilient consumption demand, government consumption will likely contract, while services sectors‚Äô growth will slip to a three-year low of 6.7% from an estimated 9.5% in 2022-23. The Manila-based Asian Development Bank (ADB) noted that a rebounding China‚Äôs and India‚Äôs domestic demand (which it believes will likely stay healthy) would lift up Asia‚Äôs growth prospects. However, it slashed its 2023-24 GDP growth forecast for India from 7.2% to 6.4%, citing tight monetary conditions and fading optimism on business conditions that it reckoned would lead to lower growth in private investments (that had only seen a fledgling post-COVID recovery till now). Apart from these domestic issues, of course, both the institutions have cited the effects of the existing challenging conditions in the global economy, which are freshly exacerbated by a spate of bank failures in the developed world and resurfacing concerns about oil prices heading north despite slowing world demand as producers cut output in unison.To be clear, the government, which presented the Union Budget around two months after the last forecasts of these institutions, of 7%-plus growth, had not articulated such high hopes for this year. The Economic Survey pegged 2023-24 growth at 6.5%, while the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) estimates it at 6.4%.
