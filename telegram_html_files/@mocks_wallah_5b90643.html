An annual affair, this is in essence a meeting of the ‚ÄòConsultative Parties,‚Äô or the 29 countries that have a right to vote on affairs concerning the management of the continent. Other attendees are countries with a non-voting ‚Äòobserver‚Äô status as well as independent experts and invited functionaries. One of the interesting points on the agenda this time relates to tourism. A group of ‚Äòlike-minded‚Äô countries, that includes India, pressed for a proposal to introduce a regulatory framework governing tourism in the continent. Unlike other continents, the Antarctica does not have its own indigenous population.</p> <p>With millions of hectares of untrammelled ice and its geographical isolation, it is not a tourist‚Äôs everyday jamboree or the elite‚Äôs regular private-jet getaway. This makes it irresistibly alluring. In this day and age, where every navigable square inch of land is up for fleeting, visual consumption, the Antarctica is the only continent that can be described as wild, its secrets buried under kilometres-thick blankets of ice. Given that the creation, capture and marketing of the ‚Äòexotic‚Äô experience is an industry that guarantees exponential returns, the Antarctica is now the ‚Äòwild south‚Äô that the wealthy traveller aspires to. A recent joint study by universities in Tasmania, the U.K. and Australia said that the number of tourists rose from 8,000 in 1993 to 1,05,000 in 2022. This does not include all the scientific expeditions and the long-term presence of scientific personnel at research stations maintained by different countries. Reports now suggest that the number of tourists exceeds scientists. To be sure, concerns about rising tourists have been expressed since 1966 at the consultative meets, with the attendant worries that more ships and more people mean more man-made pollutants and rising instances of accidents and disasters that lead to upsetting the unique biodiversity of the region. This urge to preserve the pristine purity of the continent ‚Äî estimated to be the size of the United States and Mexico combined ‚Äî however conceals the underlying anxiety of all nations. Will, despite the treaty‚Äôs commitment to disallowing territorial claims, unexpected future circumstances effect a change in terms? Will the presence of more people from one country influence terms in their favour? Though India‚Äôs Antarctica-bound tourists are minimal, this could very well change in the days to come, thanks to growing lop-sided prosperity.

The brothers spend the summer holidays playing in the mango garden, when the trees are full of fruits. They also like to eat unripe mangoes with salt and chilly powder. At home, their mother cooks unripe mangoes in different ways. She also makes many kinds of mango pickles. The pickles last through the year until the next mango season. One evening, while having food Chinnababu asked, ‚ÄúAmma, we have so many mangoes. Make some mamidi tandra (aam papad) from them.‚Äù Their father said, ‚ÄúMaking mamidi tandra needs four weeks of hardwork. If you both promise to help us everyday for the next four weeks, we can together make the mamidi tandra.‚Äù Both the brothers quickly agreed to help. The next day both the children went to the market with their father. They bought a mat woven from the leaves of a palm tree, poles of casuarina tree, string made of coconut husk, some jaggery and sugar. Amma found a sunny place in the backyard. Both the brothers made a high platform by using poles. They spread out and tied the mat on that platform. The next day, Appa chose the most ripe mangoes. They took out the mango pulp into a large pot. Then they strained the pulp through a fine muslin cloth, to remove the fibres from the pulp. Then Chittibabu crushed the gur (jaggery) till there were no lumps. They added the jaggery and sugar in equal amountsto the pulp. Chinnababu mixed the jaggery and sugar well with a big spoon. Amma then spread this pulp into a thin layer over the mat. The thin layer was left to dry in the sun. In the evening, they covered the mat with a clean saree to avoid any dust. The next day they again took out some mango pulp. They added jaggery and sugar into the pulp. Then they spread the pulp over the previous day‚Äôs layer. This work was given to both the brothers.
