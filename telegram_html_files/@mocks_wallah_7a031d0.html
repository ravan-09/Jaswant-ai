They were united by their love for stories and the wisdom they contained, and often gathered around the ancient Banyan tree to share tales from the Panchatantra.One day, as the sun dipped below the horizon, the friends noticed a distant commotion on the edge of the forest. Curiosity piqued, they ventured forth to find a group of animals arguing over a mysterious, golden book. They overheard the animals debating whether or not to open the book, fearing it might be cursed.Rishi, being the clever rabbit that he was, realized the book was a long-lost volume of the Panchatantra. He shared this insight with his friends, who were thrilled at the prospect of uncovering more stories to add to their repertoire. They decided they must obtain the book and bring it back to the Banyan tree.The friends devised a plan, inspired by the fables they knew so well. Raka the rat, being small and nimble, would sneak into the midst of the arguing animals and snatch the book away. Meanwhile, Tara the tortoise, with her steady gait, would serve as a distraction by inching towards the group, leading them on a wild goose chase.As the plan unfolded, Raka swiftly grabbed the golden book, while Tara drew the attention of the animals.

Differences exist among economists not only on data which forms the basis of their estimation, but also on trends over past decades. In the absence of official data for recent years ‚Äî the last consumption expenditure survey, which forms the basis of poverty and inequality estimates, was for 2011-12 ‚Äî the issue has been particularly contentious. More so, given the sharp differences of opinion on the extent to which the pandemic exacerbated poverty and inequality. In the absence of official data, several economists have put forth their estimates based on different data sources. For instance, Arvind Panagariya and Vishal More, using PLFS data, find that rural poverty ‚Äúsaw a modest rise‚Äù only during the strict lockdown period of April-June 2020, and then declined as sharply as in the pre-Covid period. And that while urban poverty also saw a ‚Äúmodest rise‚Äù in 2020-21, by April-June 2021 its decline had resumed.These trends are, however, at odds with studies that draw on other data sources to estimate poverty. In the ‚ÄúState of working India 2021‚Äù report, economists at Azim Premji University, based on CMIE data, found that the pandemic led to a ‚Äúsudden increase in poverty‚Äù. As per the report, over an eight month period (March to October 2020), average incomes of the bottom 10 per cent of households were lower by Rs 15,700. This income shock caused an increase in the poverty rate (below the national minimum wage threshold) by 15 percentage points in rural areas and nearly 20 percentage points in urban areas. Research by Arpit Gupta, Anup Malani and Bartosz Woda, based on CMIE data, found that income poverty, applying the World Bank‚Äôs $1.9 cutoff, rose from 7.6 per cent in November 2019 to 50.5 per cent in April 2020.
