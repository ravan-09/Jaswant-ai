While the main theatre is Gaza, which Israel has been mercilessly pounding since the October 7 Hamas attack, the conflict has effectively spread to Israel‚Äôs northern border and southern Lebanon. Over the past 10 months, Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese Shia militia, has launched hundreds of rocket attacks towards Israel, ‚Äúin solidarity with the Palestinians‚Äù. Israel has responded with air strikes on Lebanon, killing Hezbollah operatives and civilians. The trigger for the latest flare-up was the Israeli killing of Fuad Shukr, a senior commander of Hezbollah, in a strike in Beirut on July 31 ‚Äî the day Israel killed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. On August 25, after striking hundreds of Hezbollah targets, Israel said the Shia group was planning to carry out a large-scale attack and that its assault was defensive.

The U.S. supports and mediates a ceasefire, but backs Israel‚Äôs war efforts through defence supplies and diplomatic protection. Hezbollah says it will not stop attacking Israel as long as the Gaza war continues. By bombing Hezbollah and taking down its commanders, Israel is trying to change the reality on the ground, but Hezbollah‚Äôs continued attacks, which have turned northern Israel into a depopulated furling zone, suggest this approach is not very successful. When Israel began attacking Hamas, it vowed to dismantle the group. Today, even the Israeli Defense Forces doubt whether it can be destroyed. While the war on Hamas still continues, the conflict with Hezbollah is escalating. By destroying Hamas, Israel wanted to strengthen its security in the south, but the widening war has heightened its insecurity in the north.

According to a report by the Centre for Science and Environment, the extreme discomfort of the summer months in Chennai, Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Hyderabad over the last two decades is caused by a combination of air temperature, land surface temperature and relative humidity, as well as a rapid increase in built-up areas and concretisation. It poses a grave risk to lives, especially among vulnerable groups like the elderly, babies, pregnant women, those who live in slums and work outdoors.</p> <p>This is the third straight year of severe heat waves in India, which have been far longer ‚Äî over 10 days-long ‚Äî this time than the usual four to eight days. Thanks to climate change, temperatures have shot up, as has humidity. But, as the CSE report points out, the effect of this ‚Äî the moisture in the air keeps sweat from evaporating fast enough, making it seem even hotter than it actually is ‚Äî is compounded by other factors, including changes in land use and the growing urban sprawl. This has resulted in the ‚Äúurban heat island effect‚Äù: The trapping of heat due to a dense concentration of buildings, paved roads and other surfaces made of materials like concrete, glass and steel, results in higher temperatures in city centres than in the outlying areas. One alarming consequence of this is that summer nights now offer little respite from the searing heat of the day, with cities across climatic zones not cooling down at the rate they once did. This is a serious cause for concern as the heat stress continues to build, increasing the risk of heat-related illnesses and even death.</p> <p>All these factors would need to be taken into consideration for relief measures to be effective. While more than 20 states have worked with the NDMA to create heat action plans (HAP), most remain on paper. They are hampered by a lack of funding, granularity and a sustainable vision for transformation.
