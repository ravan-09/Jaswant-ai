It is often generated through illegal activities such as corruption, smuggling, and tax evasion. However, even legal businesses sometimes engage in underreporting their earnings to avoid taxes. The existence of black money weakens a country's economy by reducing government revenue, which could otherwise be used for public welfare. Various measures, such as demonetization and stricter tax laws, have been introduced by governments to curb black money.
