The SSLV can prove to be a game changer for these micro and nano space stations. The launch vehicle can be assembled in less than a week by a much smaller team. With ISRO planning to transfer technology to private players, the country‚Äôs space sector is poised for a significant expansion.</p> <p>The utility of small satellites is increasingly expanding in a variety of sectors, including weather forecasting, communications, defence, urban planning and disaster management. They are also crucial enablers in the growing Internet of Things. There is near unanimity that the market for space tech is set to increase in the next five years. US and EU companies are currently the biggest players, while China, Australia and Russia are beginning to expand their footprint. China plans to launch more than 13,000 satellites by 2030 to establish a network supporting high-speed 6G communications. India currently is a relatively smaller participant ‚Äî its current share in the space economy is about 2 per cent. With the SSLV and related endeavours, the government aims at a four-fold scale-up in the country‚Äôs stakes by 2033. In the past two years, start-ups such as those by the Hyderabad-based Skyroot and the Chennai-based Agnikul have ticked several boxes, including working closely with ISRO. Agnikul, for instance, has built its own launch pad inside the Sriharikota range with ISRO‚Äôs help. The IIT-Madras incubated company is working on a launch vehicle to carry payloads smaller than ISRO‚Äôs SSLV and it has ambitious plans to launch one rocket every week.</p> <p>India‚Äôs space policy, introduced in April last year, recognised the country‚Äôs need to transition from the ISRO-dominated ecosystem. At the same time, the policy took care to underline the premier agency‚Äôs enabling role in expanding the country‚Äôs footprint in the space economy. ISRO‚Äôs work remains crucial to diverse social objectives of the government ‚Äî education, healthcare, agriculture, climate-change mitigation and environment protection. Space tech is also critical to the country‚Äôs security objectives. The challenge now is to frame a regulatory mechanism that complements ISRO‚Äôs work, enables manufacturers of small satellites and rockets to unlock their potential while also making sure that the country‚Äôs welfare imperatives are not crowded out. The SSLV‚Äôs launch should be a prelude to conversations on such a mechanism.</p> <p><strong>What is the tone of the passage?</strong>", "options": ["<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"check\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/check.png\"/></p> Optimistic", "<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"reload\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/reload.png\"/></p> Cautionary", "<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"reload\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/reload.png\"/></p> Neutral", "<p style=\"display:none\"><img alt=\"reload\" src=\"https://englishmadhyam.info/public/exam-panel/img/reload.png\"/></p> Critical"], "correct_answer": 0, "solution": "No solution available"}, {"id": "116305", "question": "<strong>Comprehension:</strong></p> <p>Food inflation continues to undermine wider price stabilityApril‚Äôs retail inflation data flattered to deceive.
