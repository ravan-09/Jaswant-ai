Diversion of forests for the ‚Äúconstruction of roads, railway lines or projects of strategic nature near the country‚Äôs international borders‚Äù would not require clearance once the Bill becomes law. The country‚Äôs security is non-negotiable. But concerns over the de-regulation proposed in the Bill to fast-track military projects require wide-ranging deliberations, especially because most frontier zones of the country are also amongst its most ecologically fragile.</p> <p>The FCA, passed in 1980, extended protection to all lands classified as forests in government records. In 1996, a landmark ruling of the Supreme Court in the Godavarman case extended the Act‚Äôs ambit to all lands that satisfied ‚Äúthe dictionary definition of a forest‚Äù. The Court‚Äôs ruling prevented the deforestation of tracts that government surveys had not marked as forestland. But it also came in the way of removing lands that were no longer forests from the Act‚Äôs purview. Despite their stated intent of making the FCA consistent with the ‚Äúsocial and economic‚Äù realities of the country, the new amendments do not attempt to correct this anomaly. Instead, they go back to the FCA‚Äôs original remit. Conservationists fear that this could invalidate the protection accorded by the SC to large tracts of land that have the characteristics of forests but are not notified as such in government records. The Forest Survey of India‚Äôs data indicate that about 28 per cent of the country‚Äôs forests could lose protection if the Bill becomes law. The legislation proposes to compensate for such losses with clauses that enable plantations. This is a positive intervention from an agro-forestry perspective. Plantations can also sequester carbon to an extent. But they are no substitute for the large gamut of ecological services offered by natural forests.</p> <p>The Bill was placed before the Lok Sabha in March. It was referred to a Joint Committee of Parliament, which endorsed the legislation without any changes. Six Opposition members in the panel, however, dissented. They pitched for environmental audits and suggested that state governments be consulted before forest diversion orders are issued in the geologically-sensitive Himalayan and northeastern regions. Four hundred scientists and academicians and more than 100 former civil servants also expressed concerns about the process being followed in passing the Bill. They reasoned that the overwhelming majority of the BJP in the Joint Committee made the agency‚Äôs examination partisan, and requested the scrutiny of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change. Such concerns have been ignored. And now, the Lok Sabha has passed the Bill without a meaningful debate. The Rajya Sabha should do better, take all concerns on board</p> <p><strong>Q37.

The king ordered the gardener to watch the tree. The gardener's three sons took turns. The eldest two fell asleep and failed, but the youngest saw a golden bird trying to steal an apple. He shot an arrow, which didn‚Äôt hurt the bird, but it dropped a golden feather and flew away.</p> <p>The king desired the entire golden bird. The two elder sons ventured first and met a fox offering advice. It warned them about two inns they'd encounter and advised them to stay in the less appealing one. Both ignored the fox, choosing the more attractive inn, and both were sidetracked from their quest.</p> <p>The youngest son then went, heeded the fox's advice, and rode on its tail for fast travel. The fox instructed him about a castle with a sleeping army, and a room housing the golden bird in a wooden cage next to a golden one. He was warned not to transfer the bird. However, captivated by the shiny cage, the youngest son ignored the advice. The bird's screech awoke the soldiers, and he was captured.</p> <p>Facing execution, he was given a chance: retrieve the kingdom's golden horse that ran like wind. The fox again guided him, advising him to use the horse's old leather saddle. But, dazzled by the golden saddle, he ignored the counsel, alerting the guards.</p> <p>Another task was set for his life: retrieve a beautiful princess from another kingdom. With the fox's guidance, he met the princess and convinced her to leave with him. Despite being advised not to, the princess visited her parents one last time before departing, resulting in the young man's capture once again.</p> <p>The king demanded he remove a massive hill obstructing his view, seemingly an impossible task. However, the fox magically cleared it overnight, ensuring the young man's safety and his union with the princess.</p> <p>On their journey home, the fox further advised them on retrieving the golden horse and bird from his brothers. However, once near their village, the two elder brothers, turned robbers, tricked and pushed the youngest son into a river. They took the princess, bird, and horse to their kingdom, claiming the treasures as their own.</p> <p>The youngest son, trapped at the riverbed, was rescued by the fox, who warned him of his brothers' intent to kill him. Disguised as a pauper, he entered the kingdom. His presence was indicated by the horse eating, the bird singing, and the princess's cessation of her tears. He revealed his brothers' treachery, and they were punished. He married the princess and became the heir to the throne.</p> <p>Later, during a walk in the woods, the fox, who'd been his guiding force throughout, requested the young king to kill him. Reluctantly, the king agreed, and upon doing so, the fox transformed into a man, revealing another magical twist in this tale of adventure and deceit.</p> <p><strong>Q45.
