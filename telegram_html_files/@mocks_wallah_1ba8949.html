Dhanu‚Äôs mother (Aai ), the wife of mother‚Äôs brother (mami ) and the wife of father‚Äôs brother (kaki ) are busy making puranpoli (sweet rotis made from jaggery and gram). Alongwith this a spicy kadi dish is also made. The day passes in laughing and chatting. But by evening everyone‚Äôs mood changes. The women and children begin to pack their luggage. The men sit down with the mukadam (agent who lends money) for the meeting. The mukadam gives the details of the loan taken by each family. Then the talks for the next few months begin. The mukadam explains to the villagers in which areas they would go for the next six months. He also gives them some money as loan, for their expenses. Ever since Dhanu remembers, this has been the routine. Families like Dhanu‚Äôs work on the lands of big farmers till Dussehra, before the rainy season. Many other families also work on such lands. They earn just enough money to keep them going through these months. But how to manage the remaining six months, when there is no rain, and no work in the fields? So, everyone borrows money from the mukadam. To pay back this money, they have to work for the mukadam. Mukadam is an agent for sugarcane factories. He helps them to find work in sugarcane fields.

In these six months, Dhanu and many children like him will not be able to go to school. Dhanu‚Äôs old grandmother, aunt who cannot see, and two-month old cousin sister would stay back in the village. In other homes too the old and the ill people stay behind. Dhanu misses his grandmother a lot. Dhanu always keeps wondering ‚Äì who will take care of his grandmother! But, what can Dhanu do? At the factory, Dhanu‚Äôs father gets the sugarcane weighed and takes a receipt (a note to say how much sugarcane they have given). They show this receipt to the agent who then keeps an account of their loan. The agent also gives them some money for the next week‚Äôs expenses. Then Dhanu‚Äôs aai and mami take the children to the nearby village market, to buy atta (flour) and oil for the next week. Sometimes mami buys laddoos or some sweets for the children.
