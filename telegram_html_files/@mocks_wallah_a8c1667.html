Non-durable consumption items grew 6.2%, the slowest pace in three months, with total output this year still below 2021-22 levels. A K-shaped recovery may be officially denied, but industry is pointing to a slower rebound in lower income and rural segments. All is still not well.</p> <p><strong>Q41.

This village, Rosethorn, was famous for its breathtaking enchanted forest that stretched far and wide. The forest, known as the Forest of Wonder, was said to be filled with magical creatures, mesmerizing landscapes, and secrets waiting to be uncovered.One sunny spring day, Lily woke up feeling restless. It was her 12th birthday, and she decided that she was finally brave enough to venture into the Forest of Wonder on her own. With a backpack filled with snacks, water, and her favorite book of fairy tales, Lily set off on her adventure.As she entered the forest, she was immediately taken aback by its beauty. The trees towered above her, their leaves shimmering in shades of gold, silver, and emerald. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers, and the songs of birds echoed through the air. Lily was mesmerized.As she continued her journey, Lily came across a small, pristine lake, where she spotted a majestic swan gliding gracefully through the water. The swan had a golden crown resting upon its head, and its eyes sparkled with wisdom. \"Greetings, Lily,\" the swan said in a soothing voice, \"I am the Guardian of this enchanted forest, and I have been waiting for you.\"Lily was shocked, yet she quickly overcame her surprise and asked, \"How did you know my name? And why have you been waiting for me?\"The swan smiled, \"I know all who enter the Forest of Wonder, and I have sensed the magic within you. Today, on your 12th birthday, you have come of age to unlock your true potential.\"Suddenly, the golden crown on the swan's head began to glow, and with a burst of light, it transformed into a beautiful pendant. The swan carefully placed the pendant around Lily's neck, and she felt an immediate rush of energy and warmth.\"From this day forward, you will have the ability to communicate with all creatures of the enchanted forest,\" the swan explained, \"Use this gift to protect our magical realm and maintain the harmony between nature and mankind.\"Grateful and excited, Lily thanked the swan and promised to uphold her newfound responsibility. As she continued her journey through the Forest of Wonder, she befriended talking animals, witnessed enchanting sights, and discovered the beauty of nature's magic.Years passed, and Lily became the protector of the enchanted forest, using her magical pendant to communicate with its inhabitants and maintain the delicate balance of the world. The people of Rosethorn revered her as their guardian, and she became a symbol of hope, courage, and the power of love and friendship.And so, the legend of Lily and the enchanted Forest of Wonder lived on, inspiring generations to embrace the magic within themselves and cherish the beauty of the world around them.</p> <p><strong>Q42.
