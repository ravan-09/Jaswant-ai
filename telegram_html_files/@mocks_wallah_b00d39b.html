The federal funds rate now stands at 5-5.25 per cent ‚Äî its highest level in around 16 years. However, there are indications that the US Fed will now likely pause the rate hike cycle. In its last meeting in March, the policy statement had said the committee ‚Äúanticipates that some additional policy firming may be appropriate‚Äù. This framing has been dropped this time around. The more tempered statement points towards a more cautious approach, as the committee takes into consideration effects of the cumulative tightening on economic activity and inflation. Future decisions, as Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, will be taken on a ‚Äúmeeting by meeting‚Äù basis.</p> <p>Recent data shows that even as inflation has moderated in the US, it continues to remain elevated. The price index (personal consumption expenditure) moderated from 5.1 per cent in February to 4.2 per cent in March. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy components, also remained high at 4.6 per cent. This suggests that interest rates may perhaps remain higher for longer. Powell himself has acknowledged this, noting that the ‚Äúprocess of getting inflation down has a long way to go‚Äù. Tighter policy will depress consumption and investment demand, weighing down economic activity. As per the projections accompanying the last policy statement, median expectations of change in GDP were at 0.4 per cent in 2023 with the unemployment rate at 4.5 per cent. There are indications of the labour market softening. As per reports, labour market data shows that job openings declined while layoffs rose in March. Powell has admitted to the downside risks to growth, saying that ‚Äúthe case of having a recession, I don‚Äôt rule that out either: It‚Äôs possible that we will have what I hope would be a mild recession‚Äù.</p> <p>As inflation concerns continue to persist, central banks across much of the developed world are following suit. On Thursday, the European Central Bank announced its decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points as ‚Äúprice pressures remain strong‚Äù. In the UK, as inflation continues to remain stubbornly elevated, there are expectations that the Bank of England will also opt for an interest rate hike when it meets next week. However, there are risks of a sharp economic downturn even as signs emerge of the rate hike cycle drawing to a close.</p> <p><strong>Q38.
