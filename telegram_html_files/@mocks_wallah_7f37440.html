Although acknowledging that this move might attract younger individuals to the teaching profession, the author argues that this would hamper the research environment. They also critique the current education system, asserting that degree marks don't always indicate quality and NET exams can't evaluate the necessary skills for a higher education teacher. As a solution, they suggest the NET examination pattern should be restructured to assess knowledge, research skills, and teaching skills, and that the question patterns should change yearly.

It is because of PhD scholars we are producing scientific papers and holding the top position in world rankings.</p> <p>With this objective policy makers give more impetus to increase the number of doctoral degree holders every year. Even during various accreditation processes like NAAC, NIRF, DSIR, NBA etc, more thrust is given to the number of PhD holders in an institution. It is at this juncture the recent order amending the essential qualification for the post of assistant professor in higher education institutions has created confusion in the academic community. As per the new regulation PhD has become optional for the post of assistant professor in higher education institutions.</p> <p>There is indeed no correlation between higher degrees of teachers and quality of education or research. Many of our great teachers and scientists didn‚Äôt have any doctoral degrees. Degrees or academic grades alone cannot reliably gauge a candidate's research capabilities or potential.</p> <p>However, the new regulation of UGC making PhD optional in the appointment of assistant professors, though will attract youngsters towards teaching, will badly affect the research environment in higher education. The reason for the decline in higher education quality is twofold.</p> <p>The primary reason is the lack of interest among the students towards science courses. The second reason is that syllabus followed in science subjects in many universities across the country is outdated and the students who come out from our universities are not employable in the current global standards. Most of the syllabi in our state universities are prepared for the convenience of teachers.</p> <p>Even though there are provisions for research training during the undergraduate and postgraduate periods, most students and teachers don‚Äôt take it seriously. Most of the students depend on private laboratories that prepare readymade dissertation reports without doing any hands-on work, after paying the necessary amount. Even teachers who work in many colleges depend on such laboratories for their doctoral work and publications. The students who come out of such institutions don‚Äôt know the fundamentals of research.</p> <p>The marks received by present-day students cannot be taken as a marker of quality, because of the faulty evaluation scheme followed by many universities. If there is a decline in the pass percentage, the management seeks an explanation from teachers. So nowadays evaluation of answer scripts is just to satisfy the management and students. Students pursue a course that is easy to pass, looking at the pass percentage of previous years.

That evening, an unparalleled storm with winds reaching 350 km/h erupted. Heavy rain, uprooted trees, and high-velocity winds devastated the area. As the waters inundated his friend's brick house, Prashant and the family sought refuge on the roof. The super cyclone continued its destruction for thirty-six hours. By morning, everything was submerged, with only a few cement houses standing amidst floating human and animal corpses. Two fallen coconut trees on their roof provided sustenance. After two agonizing days, the rains ceased. Worried about his family, Prashant set out for his village, an eighteen-kilometre journey. Using a sturdy stick to navigate and locate shallow waters, he waded and swam through flooded paths. He joined two acquaintances on the way, and together, they maneuvered through the devastated lands, pushing away floating bodies and debris. Upon reaching his village, Kalikuda, Prashant found his home destroyed. Desperate, he headed to a Red Cross shelter, hoping to find his family. Miraculously, he discovered them, including his grandmother, siblings, uncles, and aunts, who had presumed him dead. Witnessing the dire state of the shelter, Prashant, just nineteen, took charge. He led a group to negotiate for rice from a local merchant. They succeeded, feeding the 2,500 hungry refugees. He organized a cleanup, managed medical care, and signaled helicopters for airdrops using children with utensils to symbolize hunger. Observing traumatized children orphaned by the cyclone, Prashant created a makeshift shelter, enlisting women's aid. To combat escalating grief, he engaged women in a food-for-work initiative by an NGO, while organizing sports for children, including cricket matches. Prashant and volunteers focused on rehabilitating widows and orphans, resisting government plans for institutions which lacked personal touch and empathy. They believed in community-based resettlement, pairing childless widows with orphaned children. Six months post-cyclone, Prashant's selflessness was the beacon of hope for his village's bereaved. He healed not by mourning his losses but by immersing himself in service. The young man's face became the emblem of resilience and hope in the aftermath of tragedy.</p> <p><strong>Q42.
