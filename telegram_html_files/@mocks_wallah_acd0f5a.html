The centrepiece of the slew of agreements was cooperation on the development of Chabahar Port, which could open up access to the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Central Asia and Europe. In the 21 years since, as animosity deepened between Washington and Tehran, and Delhi grew closer to the former, the development of the port slowed down. Since 2015 ‚Äî to the credit of the current government ‚Äî there has been consistent forward movement. While the coordination between Iran, India and Afghanistan may have been dampened by the Taliban‚Äôs return in Kabul, the strategic importance of Chabahar is intact. In this context, the announcement of a 10-year contract between the government‚Äôs India Ports Global LTD (IPGL) and the Ports and Maritime Organisation of Iran for the operation of a terminal at Chabahar is significant and welcome.</p> <p>IPGL will directly invest about $120 million while India has offered credit in rupees equivalent to $250 million. There is concern over US sanctions on Iran affecting India‚Äôs strategic bet with Chabahar, but these may be exaggerated. It was, after all, under Donald Trump‚Äôs tenure in 2017 ‚Äî the former US president took a hawkish stance on Iran ‚Äî that Delhi was able to get a waiver from sanctions on the Chabahar project, citing access to Afghanistan.
