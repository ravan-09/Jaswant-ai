Optimism in official circles is occasioned by various factors, one of which is the World Trade Organisation‚Äôs (WTO‚Äôs) upwardly revised forecast for trade growth. It estimates that global merchandise trade volume growth will be 1.7 per cent of world GDP in the calendar year 2023; in October 2022, its estimate was 1 per cent. Second, the $94-billion increase in exports in 2022-23 despite huge problems has made the officials upbeat. Third, they are confident that the Make in India, Make for World programme and the Rs-2 lakh crore production linked incentive (PLI) schemes to incentivise exports are doing well, especially in electronic exports. Electronics figured in the top 10 items of merchandise exports; it was 5.7 per cent in its share in 2022-23 at $25.39 billion, up from 3.71 per cent in 2021-22. US technology giant Apple has augmented its iPhone production in India substantially; it rose from 1 per cent of global production to 7 per cent in two years. Apple partners like Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp are assembling their products in India. Chinese smartphone maker Vivo will also invest Rs 1,100 crore in a new 169-acre manufacturing facility in Greater Noida. The Government believes that the $900-billion exports target is not unrealistic but it will fix the target after wide consultations with all stakeholders. Policy and decision makers, however, would do well to focus more on merchandise exports. In the last fiscal, these were $447.46 billion, up from $422 billion in 2021-22; this was a rise of merely 6 per cent. Services exports, on the other hand, grew from $254.53 billion in 2021-22 to $322.72 billion in 2022-23, registering a rise of 26.8 per cent. In other words, most of the rise in exports is because of the excellent performance of services. This is a familiar story, a story that underlines the Indian economy‚Äôs Achilles‚Äô heel‚Äîmanufacturing. National Manufacturing Policy, which was announced in 2011, aimed to increase the share of manufacturing in GDP to 25 per cent by 2025. In 2021, it was 14 per cent, down from 15 per cent in 2015. In fact, since 1960 this share never touched even the 20 per cent mark. If the Government really wants to increase merchandise exports, it has to ensure buoyancy in manufacturing. It is doing a lot directly and indirectly to boost factory output. At the Central level, there are not many procedural rigours, but the same cannot be said about the State level; it is here that industrialists, especially from micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs, face problems.

The top-secret files that were first leaked on social media websites Discord and 4chan in March this year also caused a flutter for the Joe Biden administration when it revealed confidential and unflattering information about U.S. allies, including South Korea, Israel, and other nations of West Asia and Africa, and assessments of China‚Äôs developing cyber-attack capabilities. Potentially most damaging, though, were the leaker‚Äôs posts, which, reports said, genuinely contained classified information of the U.S. military, on Ukraine‚Äôs air defences being compromised owing to a shortage of missiles in February. Also possibly undermining the tactical plans and the element of surprise for Ukrainian forces were files that spoke of the embattled country‚Äôs long-planned spring counter offensive to beat back Russian forces starting on April 30 with 12 Ukrainian brigades. While no explicit propagandistic post of the leaker has been revealed yet, it is obvious that the dots join to paint a clear picture of Mr. Teixeira‚Äôs intention to discredit the war effort of Ukraine and its western allies and show up the Biden administration in a bad light amongst its global partners.</p> <p>One thing is clear: Mr. Teixeira is no whistle-blower and, certainly, comparisons to Chelsea Manning or Edward Snowden would be misplaced. The latest leak of U.S. federal government information lacks the moral clarity and ethical underpinning of the WikiLeaks files and the NSA global surveillance expos√© that Ms. Manning and Mr. Snowden respectively shared with the world in a bid to highlight the excesses of the U.S. government and spur conversations on human rights, foreign policy and privacy in the digital age. Whistle-blowing in the latter contexts led to introspection, policy dialogue and reforms to bring about greater transparency in U.S. government actions, within limits. The 2023 Pentagon leaks have, contrarily, achieved nothing of this sort but fuelled insecurity between the U.S. and other global powers, and potentially hobbled the war strategies of the Ukrainian armed forces in their bid to fight off Russian troops attacking their country.
